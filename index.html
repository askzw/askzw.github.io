<p>I feel a sense of fullfillment when I finish this homepage. om my own homepage, I can show all of the project I finished to people, I can see my improvement in this semester, from markovsentence to geemail, I learn a lot from the class and after class, and I also owm DNS myself.
 I learned lots of security algorithms I never know before, and we need to be a security-mind programmer. And I realized that I still have space to improve my skill in programming.</p>

<p>The first project is Markovian-tweets. we need to code a tweet bot ,I learn many new function in C++ such as pop_front(),push_back(),struct, as to we never have sense about the bot, so we just finish level 1 and 2. I think I will focus on the level 3 on winter holiday. In project 2, I learned stack,chain table.before this project, I just know the function of the array, after learn the knowledge of stack, which is better than array, I finish polynomial adding and multiplication. In project 3, I finished a simple game: Minesweeper. In this project, I get to know how to create random number and understand algorithm. we create this game successful, and still have many function to improve, such as how to mark the mine, I think I will make this project more better.The last project, geemail, I get t know some  encrypt and decrypt algorithms,using SHA256 sala20 , and use mysql , which is a big challenge for me, because this project reference many function ,Although  We just finish half of it, we  still improve the skill of programming, and finally fullfill it by another way, and now I realize that we should become not only a programmer, but also a security-mind programmer, which is the core of this course</p>
