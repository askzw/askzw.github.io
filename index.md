following are four projects:

  Markovian-tweets generator
 
# 2.[polynomial](http://polynomial.zwhedegehog.us/)

  Polynomial addition and multiplication program
 
# 3.[minesweeper](http://minesweeper.zwhedegehog.us/)

  Traditional game

# 4.[geemail](http://geemail.zwhedegehog.us/)

  Secure asynchronous (same-machine) message platform.

### Introduction 

introduction of myself:

Wei Zhou

University of Delaware

Major:Electrical & computer Engineering

Master 


The project mentioned above are all in C++ style, which involve the knowledge of array, database, stack, encryption algorithm, function random(), libraries, header file, hash and so on.

I feel a sense of fullfillment when I finish this homepage. On my own homepage, I can show all of the project I finished to people, I can see my improvement after finishing these projects, from markovsentence to geemail, I learn a lot from the class and after class, and I also owm DNS myself.

 I learned lots of security algorithms I never know before, and we need to be a security-mind programmer. And I realized that I still have space to improve my skill in programming.

The first project is Markovian-tweets. The goal is to code a tweet bot ,I use many new function in C++  I never use before such as pop_front(),push_back(),struct, as to we never have sense about the bot, so we just finish level 1 and 2. 

In project 2, I use stack,chain table.before this project, I just know the function of the array, after learn the knowledge of stack, which is better than array, I finish polynomial adding and multiplication. 

In project 3, I finished a simple game: Minesweeper. In this project, I get to know how to create random number and understand algorithm. we create this game successful, and still have space to improve such as how to mark the mine, I think I will make this project more better.

The last project, geemail, I get t know some  encrypt and decrypt algorithms,using SHA256 sala20 , and use mysql , which is a big challenge for me, because this project reference many function ,I improve the skill of programming, and finally fullfill it by another way.

I realize that  I am going to  become not only a programmer, but also a security-mind programmer.
